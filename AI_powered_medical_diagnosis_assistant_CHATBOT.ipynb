        "\n",
        "User-specific information: Incorporate user details like age, gender, and medical history to personalize the diagnosis and recommendations. For example, you could avoid suggesting \"menstrual cramps\" as a possible condition for a male user.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error handling: Improve the chatbot's robustness by adding more comprehensive error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid input or missing data.\n",
        "External knowledge bases: Explore integrating more extensive medical knowledge bases or ontologies to provide a wider range of diagnoses and more detailed information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ethical considerations: Continue to refine the chatbot's responses to ensure they are responsible, ethical, and prioritize the user's well-being. Always emphasize the importance of consulting a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "By exploring these areas for improvement, you can further develop your chatbot into a more sophisticated, reliable, and helpful tool for preliminary medical diagnosis."
